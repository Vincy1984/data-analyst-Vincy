**Project 1** - Implementation of DAP of Service Request Dataset in City of Vancouver in AWS. 

**Exploratory Data Anlysis**

**Objective** 	

The City of Vancouver generates and collects vast amounts of data, with data coming from numerous sources such as permits, public services, and infrastructure records. Building a DAP is paramount for turning raw data into applied insight, enabling better decisions, resource optimization, and citizen service improvement. This platform will enable stakeholders to derive actionable insights from historical and real-time data, such as tracking infrastructure changes, monitoring public service efficiency, and predicting future needs. The city can leverage scalable cloud infrastructure by migrating to AWS to efficiently store, process, and analyze large datasets.
